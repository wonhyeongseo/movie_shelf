Source code for a Movie Trailer website, named "Movie Shelf".
It's kind of like a bookshelf, but for movies. :) [yay!]

This code may be downloaded from: https://github.com/wonhyeongseo/movie_shelf

How to use: 
1. Write your favorite movies on entertainment_center.py like the given format (until there is additional updates that will allow the "add/edit/delete" buttons on the movie_shelf.html file to function).
2. Run entertainment_center.py by double clicking it. 

File docstrings:
- media.py is a constructor module for various media- although right now there is only a movie constructor.

- movie_shelf.py creates an html file containing all of the desired movies from entertainment_center.py. I wish    to add a local database (sqlite?) for the user to add, edit, and delete movies from their own machine. Right     now I don't know how to set up a local webserver to process the GET and POST of the forms.

- entertainment_center.py is where movies are stored and sent to movie_shelf.py for the creation of the webpage.   This is where want I to create the database. But I'm not sure if it's the correct way.

I really think this can work out as a business by the way.
Users who would like to get income, review the movies and save them on their shelf.
Users who would like to watch a movie, subscribe to a shelf of their wish and buy movies from the subscribed shelf- gaining movie_points and income for the subscribee.
It would be kind of a social network for movie lovers! Thank you for reading, hope this helped in anyway possible."# movie_shelf"
